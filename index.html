            underground, and infamous for their brutality in combat.<br /><br />

            Join a team of up to 4 players to fight, dig and explore your way
            through enormous cave systems, uncover the greatest riches, and make

            A number of mysterious prospecting facilities have recently been
            discovered on Hoxxes! The operations appear to be fully automated,
            and we do not yet know who is behind the incursion. The presence of
            a Rival Company on Hoxxes is unacceptable.

            Rivals are setting up new communications equipment, which must be
            shut down! In the all-new RIVAL SIGNAL Season Event, you must
            interrupt the operation of the Rival Communications Router, hack its
            Antenna Nodes and shut it down before the timer runs out and the
            entire thing discharges a lethal energy blast! Timing and precision
            will be of the essence if you want to obtain the Data Cell stored
            inside the Router!

            The Rivals have been pushed back for the moment, but only just in
            time for a brand new threat to rear its ugly head. An insidious
            lithophage, a sickness of the very rock beneath our feet, has struck
            Hoxxes. Nicknamed the ROCKPOX, this planetary pathogen is spreading
            through the caves, infecting the rock and even directly affecting
            the local fauna. Even the hardy Dwarves can feel its insidious
            grasp. Prepare for PLAGUEFALL!
